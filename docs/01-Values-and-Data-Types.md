## numA
#5: Quickest math class ever.

Define the variable numA. Assign it the value 15.
Define the variable numB. Assign it the value 3.

Define the variable addedTo. Assign it the expression (don't solve) of numA being added to numB.
Define the variable subtractedBy. Assign it the expression (don't solve) of numA subtracted by numB.
Define the variable multipliedBy. Assign it the expression (don't solve) of numA being multiplied by numB.
Define the variable dividedBy. Assign it the expression (don't solve) of numA being divided by numB.
Define the variable moduloOf. Assign it the expression (don't solve) of numA being added to numB.

Do not reassign or directly use the values of numA and numB in the math variable value defintions.
Do not enter the solved math expression's result for any of the math variable values.

Pass numA and numB in as variables, not as their values.

**Kind**: global variable  
<a name="myFirstName"></a>

## myFirstName
#1: What's your name?

Define the variable myFirstName.
Assign it the string of your name.

**Kind**: global constant  
<a name="myAge"></a>

## myAge
#2: What's your age?

Define the variable myAge.
Assign it the value of your age.

**Kind**: global constant  
<a name="codingIsFun"></a>

## codingIsFun
#3: In fact, it's super fun.

Define the variable codingIsFun and assign it a boolean value.
There's only one right answer here.

**Kind**: global constant  
<a name="isNull"></a>

## isNull
#4: Null and undefined

Null represents the intentional absence of value.
Undefined represents a lack of defined value. Variables that are declared but don't have an initial value set will be assigned the value `undefined`.

Define two variables: isNull and isUndefined.
Assign the value null to isNull and the value undefined to isUndefined.

**Kind**: global constant  
<a name="myDetails"></a>

## myDetails
#6: Numbers and Words, all together

Define the variable myDetails.
Assign it the value of a template literal that has the myFirstName and myAge variables embedded within. DO NOT direct embed the values into myDetails.

e.g. if myFirstName = "Christian" and myAge = 32:
My name is Christian and I'm 32 years old.
